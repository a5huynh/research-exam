University of California, San Diego as part of the neverending progress towards my Ph.D.

#### **Crowdsourcing, Human Computation and Its Application to Cultural Heritage**

The abstract for the paper & presentation is below:

    In the past decade, "human computation" and "crowdsourcing" has emerged as 
    a new field of research leveraging the vast human connectivity offered by 
    the Internet to solve problems that are often too large for individuals or 
    too challenging for current automatic methods. While the physical preservation 
    of cultural heritage has been an on-going process for decades, digital 
    preservation techniques have only recently been applied to the protection, 
    documentation, and interpretation of the world's cultural heritage. 
    Crowdsourcing offers a unique way to involve the beneficiaries of the heritage 
    being preserved in the process of the actual preservation. We present several 
    examples of how crowdsourcing techniques are being utilized to protect, 
    document, and understand cultural heritage. Finally, we discuss the 
    implications of crowdsourcing on the future of cultural heritage preservation.

The original paper and presentation was presented to my research exam committee on August 20, 2013 @ 1pm.
